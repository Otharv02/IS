To explore the Confidentiality identify potential security violations through practical examples and system analysis

1.Create a File Containing Sensitive Information
 * Open a terminal or command prompt.
 * Create a text file named sensitive_file.txt:
 Linux: echo "Confidential Data: Usernames and Passwords" > sensitive_file.txt
 Windows: Open Notepad, type "Confidential Data: Usernames and Passwords", and save the file as sensitive_file.txt.

2.Restrict File Permissions
 * Set file permissions so only the owner can access it:
   Linux: Run chmod 600 sensitive_file.txt 
 Windows: Right-click the file → Properties → Security → Edit permissions → Deny access for all users except the owner.

3. Simulate Unauthorized Access
 * Switch to another user or simulate unauthorized access:
   Linux: Use su or create a new user, then try accessing the file: cat sensitive_file.txt
   Windows: Switch user accounts or create a new user, then try opening the file.

* Observe the error message (e.g., "Permission denied").
